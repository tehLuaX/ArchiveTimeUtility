# Archive Time Utility

Archive Time Utility is a simple program that stores the creation, modification and access times of all files and directories in a specified directory so that you can restore the file and directory timestamps after making a backup.

Certain archive utilities that are used for backup are unable to store the creation time of files. Archive Time Utility solves that problem by saving (before archiving) timestamps and then allowing you to overwrite the creation, modification and/or access timestamps of the extracted files.

This software is FOSS (free and open source software) and was written using C# and was currently only tested on Windows.
